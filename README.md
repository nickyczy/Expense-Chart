# Frontend Mentor - Expenses chart component

Hello all!
New web dev student here!
Making a career change from Chef to Web dev!
This challenge was incredibly fun using ChartJs.
It was fun reading documentations and learning to configure these things.
Only trouble i have was getting the @media screen issue below 375px AND how to import JSON file and file changes according to changes in the JSON file.

Any help would be highly appreciated. PLEASE I WOULD LOVE TO LEARN.

Improvements that could be added to this project:

1. Chart automatically highlights the highest amount in expenses.
2. Balance and Total counter changes based on data changes.

I hope i can learn a lot more from you mentors.
